  // ============================================
  // CHAPTER 1: WELCOME (Slides 1-2)
  // ============================================

  1: `Good morning! Thank you for having me here today. I'm honored to speak with the Downtown Durham Rotary Club about the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.`,

  2: `Our mission is simple but profound: to advance our state, nation, and world by creating opportunities for exemplary public education. This has guided everything we've done for over forty-five years.`,

  // ============================================
  // CHAPTER 2: OUR STORY (Slides 3-5)
  // ============================================

  3: `NCSSM was founded in nineteen eighty by Governor Jim Hunt, Senator Terry Sanford, and author John Ehle. Their vision was bold: invest in North Carolina's human and intellectual capital. We became America's first public residential STEM high school.`,

  4: `Since then, eighteen similar schools worldwide have been modeled after NCSSM. We didn't just create a school — we created a movement in public education.`,

  5: `In two thousand seven, we became the only high school in the UNC System — the seventeenth institution joining universities like Chapel Hill, NC State, and East Carolina.`,

  // ============================================
  // CHAPTER 3: BY THE NUMBERS (Slides 6-9)
  // ============================================

  6: `Today we operate two residential campuses. Our original Durham campus, established in nineteen eighty, serves six hundred eighty students. Our newer Morganton campus, opened in twenty twenty-two, serves three hundred students. Durham students are the Unicorns, Morganton students are the Dragons.`,

  7: `But our impact extends far beyond our residential students. We serve over thirty-five hundred students annually across all our programs — residential, online, and outreach.`,

  8: `Here's something that makes us truly special: NCSSM is one hundred percent free. No tuition. No room and board. No fees. We've been fully state-funded since nineteen eighty, open to students from all one hundred North Carolina counties.`,

  9: `Admission is competitive. We receive around two thousand applications each year for a twenty-four percent acceptance rate. Every single North Carolina county is represented in our student body.`,

  // ============================================
  // CHAPTER 4: PROGRAMS (Slides 10-12)
  // ============================================

  10: `Our core is a rigorous two-year residential program. Students take advanced STEM and humanities courses, live in a learning community, conduct research mentorships with Triangle universities, and participate in athletics and extracurriculars.`,

  11: `Our research opportunities are unmatched at the high school level. Students work alongside researchers at Duke, NC State, UNC Chapel Hill, and RTI International. Over one hundred professional mentors volunteer their time each year.`,

  12: `We also serve students who remain at their local high schools. NCSSM Online offers evening honors courses. NCSSM Connect provides free AP classes via video conference. Summer Ventures is a free four-week summer program that's been running for forty years. And we provide free professional development training for K-12 teachers statewide.`,

  // ============================================
  // CHAPTER 5: SUCCESS (Slides 13-15)
  // ============================================

  13: `The results speak for themselves. Niche dot com ranked us the number one best public high school in America for twenty twenty-six. We've been number one in North Carolina for five consecutive years.`,

  14: `We are a true STEM pipeline for North Carolina. Sixty-eight percent of our graduates earn STEM degrees — that's three times the national average. Fifty-five percent work in STEM fields — four times the national average.`,

  15: `All residential program graduates receive guaranteed admission to any UNC System school, plus four-year tuition grants. We're making sure these talented students can afford to continue their education in North Carolina.`,

  // ============================================
  // CHAPTER 6: IMPACT (Slides 16-19)
  // ============================================

  16: `Our economic contribution to North Carolina is substantial: one point three four billion dollars annually. This investment in our students pays dividends for decades.`,

  17: `And importantly, this investment stays in North Carolina. Fifty-four percent of our alumni live and work right here in the state. The average alumni income exceeds one hundred ten thousand dollars. We've graduated over twelve thousand students since nineteen eighty.`,

  18: `Our alumni believe in giving back. The Ignite plus Transform Campaign raised eighty-six million dollars — the largest campaign for a public high school in America. Eighty-four hundred donors contributed, with alumni providing forty-six percent of the total.`,

  19: `Our graduates work across every field: computer science, business, education, medicine, and engineering are the top five employment areas.`,

  // ============================================
  // CHAPTER 7: NOTABLE ALUMNI (Slides 20-22)
  // ============================================

  20: `Let me share some alumni who exemplify our mission. Christina Koch, class of ninety-seven, is a NASA astronaut.

And this year, she'll fly around the Moon on Artemis Two.`,
